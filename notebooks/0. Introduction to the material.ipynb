    "# Introduction to the material\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase the skill level of the team at [CEAi](http://ceai.io), we aim to organize \"precision workshops\", or workshops set up to maximize useful output for the group. The main idea behind precision workshops is solid preparation such that all participants of the workshop are at approximately the same level and that level is already somewhat beyond introductory. Such preparation should result in a workshop that is useful for all members, yet addresses advanced topics instead of the basics.  The following material is intended for machine learners that want to get acquainted with MCMC and has a strong coding/product focus.  This material together with the Precision workshop itself should build enough knowledge and confidence in people to use the following techniques in shipped products.\n",
    "\n",
    "This material is built (on top of other material, see credits) to facilitate preparation for our first precision workshop on Bayesian modelling in May 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape and form of the content was also inspired by the following quotes\n",
    "\n",
    ">  \"Don't ever stop programming.\" - Geoff Hinton, in [interview with Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eyhCTvrEtE)\n",
    "\n",
    ">  \"What people appreciated most about CS231n was that they would program everything from scratch, no libraries.\" - Andrej Karpathy, in [interview with Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_au3yw46lcg)\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This material should get the reader acquainted with the following topics and our open-ended exercises serve to build a solid grasp of each topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic proficiency in Bayesian modelling\n",
    "  - Refresher: commonly used probability distributions\n",
    "  - Construction of models from standard building blocks\n",
    "  - Understanding the PyMC3 library\n",
    "  - Clarity on various steps needed to write a model \n",
    "- Understanding inference via MCMC\n",
    "  - The Monte Carlo approach\n",
    "  - Basic sampling algorithms\n",
    "  - Markov Chain Monte Carlo as a method of estimating the posterior\n",
    "  - Understanding the Metropolis sampling algorithm in detail\n",
    "  - Basic idea behind more advanced samplers: HMC, NUTS\n",
    "- Understand the idea of variational inference\n",
    "  - What is variational inference?\n",
    "  - The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)\n",
    "  - Mean field variational inference + example\n",
    "  \n",
    "At the end of the preparation the reader should be able to write and apply a simple Bayesian model from scratch using classical (albeit inefficient) methods including an MCMC sampler and also write such models in PyMC3.  This will facilitate a deeper appreciation and understanding of the underlying problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a side goal, we present some interesting models and provide a taste of some recent cool theoretical advances.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Also, last but not least: have fun!"

    "## Precision workshop 1 target content\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, the Precision workshop will further build upon this basis with key topics like:\n",
    "- Building great models - heuristics, criticism, experiences\n",
    "- Advanced MCMC, diagnostics, improvements\n",
    "- Critiquing models of immediate interest in current startups at CEAi, consulting\n",
    "- Model checking - answer to the question: is my model ready for the real world"

    "The original material on which these notebooks expand is the excellent [tutorial](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/PyMC3_DataScienceLA) by [Chris Fonnesbeck](https://twitter.com/fonnesbeck?lang=en) that was published under CCL 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have tried to tweak the content and add new content to maximize explanatory power and reduce friction when learning but beware - Bayesian modelling is not an easy topic. This material is made available under the same license as the original tutorial by Chris Fonnesbeck (CCL 1.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other sources include:\n",
    "- Examples from [Getting started in PyMC3](http://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/getting_started.html) (Apache License 2.0)\n",
    "- Various talks by David MacKay, Ian Murray and many others on the problem of inference"
