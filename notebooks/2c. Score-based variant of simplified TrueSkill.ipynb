    "The TrueSkill model is a replacement for the Chess ELO skill estimate system, which converges faster, handles team play and with approximate inference using message passing, can be run online for about 100M players.  The objective of the system is to find players, who are well matched in skills so that they have fun playing.\n",

    "TrueSkill models game outcomes based on **player skill** $s_i$, which affects **game performance** of an individual in a game. The performance in teams is estimates as the sum of performance of the team players. At this point, we diverge in our example and assume that the difference in performance predicts the difference in score.  The model is shown on the illustration below."
