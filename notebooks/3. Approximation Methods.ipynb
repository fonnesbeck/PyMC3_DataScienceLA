    "Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the *de facto* standard for the estimation of Bayesian models. It is an important and useful approach because it is asymptotically exact and can be implemented readily in software and applied to a wide range of probabilistic models. The main drawback of MCMC, however, is its **computational expense**, as it requires repeated calculation of likelihoods and other quantities at every iteration of the algorithm. These calculations typically involve all of the data specified in the model, and hence do not scale well with the size of the dataset being used to fit the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to this employs one of several *approximation* methods. By an approximation, we are here referring to methods that do not exactly calculate or sample from the full posterior distribution specified by the model, but rather, either returns one or more moments of the posterior or use an alternative functional form in place of the true posterior distribution. \n",
