    "### Sampling Markov Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation above assumes that the draws of $\\theta$ are **independent**. The limitation in using Monte Carlo sampling for Bayesian inference is that it is not usually feasible to make independent draws from the posterior distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first \"MC\" in MCMC stands for **Markov chain**. A Markov chain is a **stochastic process**, an indexed set of random variables, where the value of a particular random variable in the set is dependent only on the random variable corresponding to the prevous index. This is a Markovian dependence structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Pr(X_{t+1}=x_{t+1} | X_t=x_t, X_{t-1}=x_{t-1},\\ldots,X_0=x_0) = Pr(X_{t+1}=x_{t+1} | X_t=x_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This conditioning specifies that the future depends on the current state, but not past states. Thus, the Markov chain wanders about the state space, remembering only where it has just been in the last time step. The collection of transition probabilities is sometimes called a *transition matrix* when dealing with discrete states, or more generally, a *transition kernel*.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCMC allows us to generate samples from a particular posterior distribution as a Markov chain. The magic is that the resulting sample, even though it is dependent in this way, is indistinguishable from an independent sample from the true posterior."

    "An important consideration is the specification of the scale parameter for the random walk error distribution. Large values produce random walk steps that are highly exploratory, but tend to produce proposal values in the tails of the target distribution, potentially resulting in very small acceptance rates. Conversely, small values tend to be accepted more frequently, since they tend to produce proposals close to the current parameter value, but may result in chains that mix very slowly.\n",
